How MySQL is used with advanced data analytics tools
This reading item provides an overview of the relationship between MySQL and advanced data analytics tools.  

Data analytics overview
Data analytics is a key concern for all kinds of organizations across a range of sectors including education, government, health, tourism and business.

Data analytics is concerned with collecting, processing, and investigating data to gain deep insights into an organization’s performance. For example, a business can use data analytics to gain insights into their sales patterns, customer behavior or profit margins.

Data analytics provides useful and meaningful information that an organization’s decision makers can leverage to deal with problems and challenges at an early stage. It also helps them to predict the future of their organization.  

Benefits of using MySQL for data analytics
There are several benefits to using MySQL for data analytics. 

MySQL databases are built using relational models. These models store data sets in related tables, which makes it much easier to access, process and analyze existing data.

It’s also an open-source database management system that can store huge amounts of data. In database analytics, the more data your database stores and processes, the better the results of your analysis.

MySQL is widely used by various types of businesses, social network platforms, e-commerce applications, and government websites. This means that it’s much easier for these organizations to integrate imported data from multiple sources, which will facilitate a rich environment of data to perform data analytics.

MySQL and advanced data analytics tools
MySQL’s ability to perform data analytics is adequate. However, it’s capacity for advanced analytical processing is much more limited than comparable advanced analytical tools

MySQL is more focused on data transaction processing rather than analytics, where records of data are managed in tables within rows and columns through SQL operations such as the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations.

Business owners and managers need to perform sophisticated data analytics operations. So, they often integrate MySQL with other advanced analytics platforms to optimize the benefits of data analytics.

These other platforms provide user-friendly interfaces for dealing with data. They also present analyzed data in a variety of visual formats such as charts, graphs, maps and interactive dashboards.

Generating data or information in these visual formats is a useful method of identifying trends, gaps, patterns and models. It’s much easier to work with than raw data in tables because visual information can be processed by the human brain much faster. 

MySQL can be integrated with many advanced analytical tools including the two most popular platforms Tableau and Power BI. Tableau is the most popular analytical platform in the world. Power BI is an important interactive data visualization tool developed by Microsoft. Its primary focus is on business intelligence.

Both Tableau and Power BI are advanced visualization tools that are used to access, connect and analyze data from various sources. They can then convert analyzed data into interactive dashboards. 

These platforms also contain built-in connectors that facilitate easy integration, visualization and analysis of MySQL data by supporting the Select, Extract, Transform and Load (SETL) mechanism.

These tools can be used to easily identify MySQL data to be analyzed. They extract the selected data, transform it into a suitable format and load the data onto the platform to perform different types of data analytics.

Conclusion
MySQL is used by many kinds of organizations to maintain huge amounts of data in relational databases. It’s easy to access, integrate, process and analyze. However, MySQL's ability to perform data analytics is very limited compared to other advanced data analytics tools. These other tools can perform much more effective analysis using artificial intelligence and data visualization.
